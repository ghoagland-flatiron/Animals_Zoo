# Zoo Lab

Welcome to your first day as a Flatiron Zookeeper!
Today, we are being asked to create two domain models - a `Zoo` model and an `Animal` model and build out their relationships! Keep in mind that an animal can only be in one location at a time!

Here are some of our deliverables:

## Zoo Class
<!-- - A zoo should be initialized with a name and a location, which should both be passed as strings. -->
<!-- - `Zoo.all` should return an array of all the zoo instances. -->
<!-- - `Zoo#animals` should return all the animals that a specific instance of zoo has. -->
<!-- - `Zoo#animal_names` should return an array of all the types of the animals in the zoo. -->
<!-- - `Zoo#find_by_type` should take in the animal's type as an argument and return an array of all the animals in that zoo, which are of that type. -->
<!-- - `Zoo.find_by_location` should take in a location as an argument and return an array of all the zoos with that location. -->

## Animal Class
<!-- - An animal should be instantiated with the type (e.g. "Cat", "Dog", "Rat") and a numerical weight. Keep in mind that the animal's type should not be able to change, but its weight can. -->
<!-- - `Animal.all` should return an array of all the animal instances. -->
<!-- - `Animal#zoo` should return the zoo instance that the instance belongs to. -->
<!-- - `Animal.find_by_type` should take in an animal's type as an argument and return an array of all the animals, which are of that type. -->

There are no restrictions and no tests, so it's up to you to decide how to implement this!
